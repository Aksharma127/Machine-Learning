Findings\n","*   The explicit setting of `booster.set_param('base_score', 0.5)` was removed from the model configuration. This change was implemented to allow `onnxmltools` to implicitly handle the `base_score` parameter directly from the `XGBClassifier` model.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","*   This modification simplifies the model conversion process by allowing `onnxmltools` to infer the `base_score` parameter automatically, potentially reducing redundancy and ensuring consistent behavior with the original `XGBClassifier` settings.\n","*   The next step should involve verifying that the `onnxmltools` conversion accurately reflects the `base_score` from the `XGBClassifier` without the explicit setting, and that the converted model performs as expected.\n"]}]}
